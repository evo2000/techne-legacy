            <h1>synesthesia</h1>
            
            <p>This project was a collaboration with a student majoring in New Media at SUNY Purchase. Their final project in an experimental sound design class involved a musical performance played over a recording of a poem. To add a visual element to the experience, I designed an Arduino-based device which displayed different colors of light on an LED strip based on the range of notes played on the keyboard used for the performance.</p>

            <p>The most significant issue that I ran into during construction was that both reading the MIDI data from the keyboard and writing values to the LED were processor intensive tasks, and could not be handled by a single microcontroller. Instead I divided the tasks among two boards, with one reading an optoisolated MIDI signal through a breakout board and sending corresponding analog signals to a second board, which lit specific ranges of the LED strip according to the data from the first board. A third board was added to control a strobe light with a foot pedal, but was not implemented in the performance below. All of the control electronics were housed in a shoebox, as can be seen above.</p>
