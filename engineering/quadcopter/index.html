            <h1>quadcopter</h1>
            
            <p>I have been interested in multirotor aircraft even before their recent increase in polularity. A few years before quadcopters started to become part of the mainstream in consumer electronics, I had an idea for a multirotor which used differential thrust vectoring to orient itself, a design which I still plan on pursuing.</p>

            <p>A majority of the components comprising this quadcopter are made by DJI, and thus work very smoothly together. In addition to the flight electronics onboard, I added a small camera and a video transmitter. The video signal can be recieved and displayed on a set of video goggles, worn by the user.</p>

            <p>I have several ideas for future additions to this project, centered around an open source Flight Management Unit such as the PixHawk 4. I would like to experiment with infrared sensitive cameras and night flying, as well as test out different thrust vectoring and ducted propeller ideas which should improve performance and efficiency.</p>
